<p>This successful track record stems from our experienced attorneys, including many who came to the Firm from federal or state law enforcement agencies. &nbsp;The Firm also includes several dozen former federal and state judicial clerks.</p>

                 <p>As recent corporate scandals demonstrate clearly, it has become all too common for companies and their executives &ndash; often with the help of their advisors, such as bankers, lawyers and accountants &ndash; to manipulate the market price of their securities by misleading the public about the company&rsquo;s financial condition or prospects for the future.&nbsp; This misleading information has the effect of artificially inflating the price of the company&rsquo;s securities above their true value.&nbsp; When the underlying truth is eventually revealed, the prices of these securities plummet, harming those innocent investors who relied upon the company&rsquo;s misrepresentations.</p>

<p>Robbins Geller is the leader in the fight to protect investors from corporate securities fraud.&nbsp; We utilize a wide range of federal and state laws to provide investors with remedies, either by bringing a class action on behalf of all affected investors or, where appropriate, by bringing individual cases.</p>

<p>The Firm&rsquo;s reputation for excellence has been repeatedly noted by courts and has resulted in the appointment of Firm attorneys to lead roles in hundreds of complex class-action securities and other cases.&nbsp; In the securities area alone, the Firm&rsquo;s attorneys have been responsible for a number of outstanding recoveries on behalf of investors.&nbsp; Currently, Robbins Geller attorneys are lead or named counsel in hundreds of securities class action or large institutional-investor cases.&nbsp; Some notable current and past cases include:</p>               </p>

Ill.).&nbsp; As sole lead counsel, Robbins Geller obtained a record-breaking settlement of <strong><em>$1.575 billion</em></strong> after 14 years of litigation, including a six-week jury trial in 2009 that resulted in a securities fraud verdict in favor of the class.&nbsp; In 2015, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the jury&rsquo;s verdict that defendants made false or misleading statements of material fact about the company&rsquo;s business practices and financial results, but remanded the case for a new trial on the issue of whether the individual defendants &ldquo;made&rdquo; certain false statements, whether those false statements caused plaintiffs&rsquo; losses, and the amount of damages.&nbsp; The parties reached an agreement to settle the case just hours before the retrial was scheduled to begin on June 6, 2016.&nbsp; <em><strong>The $1.575 billion settlement, approved in October 2016, is the largest ever following a securities fraud class action trial, the largest securities fraud settlement in the Seventh Circuit and the seventh-largest settlement ever in a post-PSLRA securities fraud case.</strong></em>&nbsp; According to published reports, the case was just the seventh securities fraud case tried to a verdict since the passage of the PSLRA.

	<strong><em>In re UnitedHealth Grp. Inc. PSLRA Litig.</em></strong>, No. 06-CV-1691 (D. Minn.).&nbsp; Robbins Geller represented the California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System (&ldquo;CalPERS&rdquo;) and demonstrated its willingness to vigorously advocate for its institutional clients, even under the most difficult circumstances.&nbsp; The Firm obtained an $895 million recovery on behalf of the UnitedHealth shareholders, and former CEO William A. McGuire paid $30 million and returned stock options representing more than three million shares to the shareholders, bringing the total recovery for the class to over $925 million, the largest stock option backdating recovery ever, and <strong><em>a recovery that is more than four times larger than the next largest options backdating recovery</em></strong>.&nbsp; Moreover, Robbins Geller obtained unprecedented corporate governance reforms, including election of a shareholder-nominated member to the company&rsquo;s board of directors, a mandatory holding period for shares acquired by executives via option exercise, and executive compensation reforms that tie pay to performance.

The lawsuit focused on Wachovia&rsquo;s exposure to &ldquo;pick-a-pay&rdquo; loans, which the bank&rsquo;s offering materials said were of &ldquo;pristine credit quality,&rdquo; but which were actually allegedly made to subprime borrowers, and which ultimately massively impaired the bank&rsquo;s mortgage portfolio.&nbsp; Robbins Geller served as co-lead counsel representing the City of Livonia Employees&rsquo; Retirement System, Hawaii Sheet Metal Workers Pension Fund, and the investor class.

Nacchio and Robert S. Woodruff, the CEO and CFO, respectively, of Qwest during large portions of the class period.

The settlement in this action includes numerous corporate governance reforms designed to, among other things: (i) increase director independence; (ii) provide continuing education to directors; (iii) enhance the company&rsquo;s internal controls; (iv) make the company&rsquo;s board more independent; and (iv) strengthen the company&rsquo;s internal audit function.

Johnson (CEO of Progress) and replace him with Duke&rsquo;s then-CEO, John Rogers.&nbsp; This historic settlement represents the largest recovery ever in a North Carolina securities fraud action, and one of the five largest recoveries in the Fourth Circuit.

Travis Laster found defendant RBC Capital Markets, LLC liable for aiding and abetting Rural/Metro&rsquo;s board of directors&rsquo; fiduciary duty breaches in the $438 million buyout of Rural/Metro, citing &ldquo;the magnitude of the conflict between RBC&rsquo;s claims and the evidence.&rdquo;&nbsp; RBC was ordered to pay nearly $110 million as a result of its wrongdoing, the largest damage award ever obtained against a bank over its role as a merger adviser.&nbsp; The Delaware Supreme Court issued a landmark opinion affirming the judgment on November 30, 2015, <em>RBC Capital Mkts., LLC v.

                 <p>Fraud and collusion in the insurance industry by executives, agents, brokers, lenders and others is one of the most costly crimes in the United States.&nbsp; Some experts have estimated the annual cost of white collar crime in the insurance industry to be over $120 billion nationally.&nbsp; Recent legislative proposals seek to curtail anti-competitive behavior within the industry.&nbsp; However, in the absence of comprehensive regulation, Robbins Geller has played a critical role as private attorney general in protecting the rights of consumers against insurance fraud and other unfair business practices within the insurance industry.</p>

<p>Robbins Geller attorneys have long been at the forefront of litigating race discrimination issues within the life insurance industry.&nbsp; For example, the Firm has fought the practice by certain insurers of charging African-Americans and other people of color more for life insurance than similarly situated Caucasians.&nbsp; The Firm recovered over $400 million for African-Americans and other minorities as redress for civil rights abuses, including landmark recoveries in <em>McNeil v. American General Life &amp; Accident Insurance Company</em>; <em>Thompson v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company</em>; and <em>Williams v. United Insurance Company of America</em>.</p>

<p>The Firm&rsquo;s attorneys fight on behalf of elderly victims targeted for the sale of deferred annuity products with hidden sales loads and illusory bonus features.&nbsp; Sales agents for life insurance companies such as Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America, Midland National Life Insurance Company, and National Western Life Insurance Company targeted senior citizens for these annuities with lengthy investment horizons and high sales commissions.&nbsp; The Firm recovered millions of dollars for elderly victims and seeks to ensure that senior citizens are afforded full and accurate information regarding deferred annuities.</p>

<p>Robbins Geller attorneys also stopped the fraudulent sale of life insurance policies based on misrepresentations about how the life insurance policy would perform, the costs of the policy, and whether premiums would &ldquo;vanish.&rdquo; Purchasers were also misled about the financing of a new life insurance policy, falling victim to a &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; or &ldquo;churning&rdquo; sales scheme where they were convinced to use loans, partial surrenders or withdrawals of cash values from an existing permanent life insurance policy to purchase a new policy.</p>

	<strong>Brokerage &ldquo;Pay to Play&rdquo; Cases</strong>. On behalf of individuals, governmental entities, businesses, and non-profits, Robbins Geller has sued the largest commercial and employee benefit insurance brokers and insurers for unfair and deceptive business practices. While purporting to provide independent, unbiased advice as to the best policy, the brokers failed to adequately disclose that they had entered into separate &ldquo;pay to play&rdquo; agreements with certain third-party insurance companies. These agreements provide additional compensation to the brokers based on such factors as profitability, growth and the volume of insurance that they place with a particular insurer, and are akin to a profit-sharing arrangement between the brokers and the insurance companies. These agreements create a conflict of interest since the brokers have a direct financial interest in selling their customers only the insurance products offered by those insurance companies with which the brokers have such agreements.


<p style="margin-left:40px">Robbins Geller attorneys were among the first to uncover and pursue the allegations of these practices in the insurance industry in both state and federal courts. On behalf of the California Insurance Commissioner, the Firm brought an injunctive case against the biggest employee benefit insurers and local San Diego brokerage, ULR, which resulted in major changes to the way they did business. The Firm also sued on behalf of the City and County of San Francisco to recover losses due to these practices. Finally, Robbins Geller represents a putative nationwide class of individuals, businesses, employers, and governmental entities against the largest brokerage houses and insurers in the nation. To date, the Firm has obtained over $200 million on behalf of policyholders and enacted landmark business reforms.</p>

                 <p>Individual inventors, universities, and research organizations provide the fundamental research behind many existing and emerging technologies.&nbsp; Every year, the majority of U.S. patents are issued to this group of inventors.&nbsp; Through this fundamental research, these inventors provide a significant competitive advantage to this country.&nbsp; Unfortunately, while responsible for most of the inventions that issue into U.S. patents every year, individual inventors, universities and research organizations receive very little of the licensing revenues for U.S. patents.&nbsp; Large companies reap 99% of all patent licensing revenues.</p>

<p>Robbins Geller enforces the rights of these inventors by filing and litigating patent infringement cases against infringing entities.&nbsp; Our attorneys have decades of patent litigation experience in a variety of technical applications.&nbsp; This experience, combined with the Firm&rsquo;s extensive resources, gives individual inventors the ability to enforce their patent rights against even the largest infringing companies.</p>

<p>Our attorneys have experience handling cases involving a broad range of technologies, including:</p>


	biochemistry
	telecommunications
	medical devices
	medical diagnostics
	networking systems
	computer hardware devices and software
	mechanical devices
	video gaming technologies

	<strong><em>Does I v. The Gap, Inc.</em></strong>, No. 01 0031 (D. N. Mar. I.).&nbsp; In this groundbreaking case, Robbins Geller attorneys represented a class of 30,000 garment workers who alleged that they had worked under sweatshop conditions in garment factories in Saipan that produced clothing for top U.S. retailers such as The Gap, Target and J.C. Penney.&nbsp; In the first action of its kind, Robbins Geller attorneys pursued claims against the factories and the retailers alleging violations of RICO, the Alien Tort Claims Act, and the Law of Nations based on the alleged systemic labor and human rights abuses occurring in Saipan.&nbsp; This case was a companion to two other actions: <strong><em>Does I v. Advance Textile Corp.</em></strong>, No. 99 0002 (D. N. Mar. I.), which alleged overtime violations by the garment factories under the Fair Labor Standards Act and local labor law, and <strong><em>UNITE v. The Gap, Inc.</em></strong>, No. 300474 (Cal. Super. Ct., San Francisco Cty.), which alleged violations of California&rsquo;s Unfair Practices Law by the U.S. retailers.&nbsp; These actions resulted in a settlement of approximately $20 million that included a comprehensive monitoring program to address past violations by the factories and prevent future ones.&nbsp; The members of the litigation team were honored as Trial Lawyers of the Year by the Trial Lawyers for Public Justice in recognition of the team&rsquo;s efforts at bringing about the precedent-setting settlement of the actions.

	<strong><em>Liberty Mutual Overtime Cases</em></strong>, No. JCCP 4234 (Cal. Super. Ct., Los Angeles Cty.).&nbsp; Robbins Geller attorneys served as co-lead counsel on behalf of 1,600 current and former insurance claims adjusters at Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and several of its subsidiaries.&nbsp; Plaintiffs brought the case to recover unpaid overtime compensation and associated penalties, alleging that Liberty Mutual had misclassified its claims adjusters as exempt from overtime under California law.&nbsp; After 13 years of complex and exhaustive litigation, Robbins Geller secured a settlement in which Liberty Mutual agreed to pay $65 million into a fund to compensate the class of claims adjusters for unpaid overtime.&nbsp; The Liberty Mutual action is one of a few claims adjuster overtime actions brought in California or elsewhere to result in a successful outcome for plaintiffs since 2004.

<p>Led by 20-year litigation veteran Tor Gronborg, and advised by Lea Bays, e-discovery counsel, and Christine Milliron, Director of E-Discovery and Litigation Support, the Robbins Geller e-discovery practice group is a multi-disciplinary team of attorneys, forensic analysts and database professionals.&nbsp; No plaintiffs&rsquo; firm is better equipped to develop the type of comprehensive and case specific e-discovery strategy that is necessary for today&rsquo;s complex litigation.&nbsp; The attorneys have extensive knowledge and experience in drafting and negotiating sophisticated e-discovery protocols, including those involving the use of predictive coding.&nbsp; High quality document review services are performed by a consistent group of staff attorneys who are experienced in the Firm&rsquo;s litigation practice areas and specialize in document review and analysis.&nbsp; A team of forensic and technology professionals work closely with the attorneys to ensure an effective and efficient e-discovery strategy.&nbsp; The litigation support team includes six Relativity Certified Administrators.&nbsp; Collectively, the Robbins Geller forensic and technology professionals have more than 75 years of e-discovery experience.</p>

<p>Members of the practice group are also leaders in shaping the broader dialogue on e-discovery issues.&nbsp; They regularly contribute to industry publications, speak at conferences organized by leading e-discovery think tanks such as The Sedona Conference and Georgetown University Law Center&rsquo;s Advanced eDiscovery Institute, and play prominent roles in the local chapters of Women in eDiscovery and the Relativity Users Steering Committee.&nbsp; The e-discovery practice group also offers regular in-house training and education, ensuring that members of the Firm are always up-to-date on the evolving world of e-discovery law and technology.</p>

<p>Robbins Geller has always been a leader in document-intensive litigation.&nbsp; Boasting high-performing infrastructure resources, state-of-the-art technology, and a deep bench of some of the most highly trained Relativity Certified Administrators and network engineers, the Firm&rsquo;s capabilities rival, if not outshine, those of the top e-discovery vendors in the industry.&nbsp; Additionally, the Firm&rsquo;s implementation of advanced analytic technologies and custom workflows makes its work fast, smart and efficient.&nbsp; Combined with Robbins Geller&rsquo;s decision to manage and host its litigation support in-house, these technologies reduce the Firm&rsquo;s reliance on third-party vendors, enabling it to offer top-notch e-discovery services to clients at a fair and reasonable cost.</p>

<p>Security is a top priority at Robbins Geller.&nbsp; The Firm&rsquo;s hosted e-discovery is secured using bank-level 128 encryption and is protected behind state-of-the-art Cisco firewalls.&nbsp; All e-discovery data is hosted on Firm-owned equipment at an SSAE 16-compliant, SOC 1, 2, and 3 audited facility that features 9.1 megawatts of power, N+1 or better redundancy on all data center systems, and security protocols required by leading businesses in the most stringent verticals.&nbsp; Originally designed to support a large defense contractor, it is built to rigorous standards, complete with redundant power and cooling systems plus multiple generators.</p>

	<strong><em>In re Enron Corp. Sec. Litig</em></strong>., No. H-01-3624 (S.D. Tex.).&nbsp; Investors lost billions of dollars as a result of the massive fraud at Enron.&nbsp; In appointing Robbins Geller lawyers as sole lead counsel to represent the interests of Enron investors, the court found that the Firm&rsquo;s zealous prosecution and level of &ldquo;insight&rdquo; set it apart from its peers.&nbsp; Robbins Geller attorneys and lead plaintiff The Regents of the University of California aggressively pursued numerous defendants, including many of Wall Street&rsquo;s biggest banks, and successfully obtained settlements in excess of <strong><em>$7.2 billion</em></strong> for the benefit of investors.&nbsp; <em><strong>This is the largest securities class action recovery </strong></em><em><strong>in history</strong></em>.


<p style="margin-left:40px">The court overseeing this action had utmost praise for Robbins Geller&rsquo;s efforts and stated that &ldquo;[t]he experience, ability, and reputation of the attorneys of [Robbins Geller] is not disputed; it is one of the most successful law firms in securities class actions, if not the preeminent one, in the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>In re Enron Corp. Sec., Derivative &amp; &ldquo;ERISA&rdquo; Litig.</em>, 586 F. Supp. 2d 732, 797 (S.D. Tex. 2008).</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">The court further commented: &ldquo;[I]n the face of extraordinary obstacles, the skills, expertise, commitment, and tenacity of [Robbins Geller] in this litigation cannot be overstated.&nbsp; Not to be overlooked are the unparalleled results, . . . which demonstrate counsel&rsquo;s clearly superlative litigating and negotiating skills.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>Id</em>. at 789.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">The court stated that the Firm&rsquo;s attorneys &ldquo;are to be commended for their zealousness, their diligence, their perseverance, their creativity, the enormous breadth and depth of their investigations and analysis, and their expertise in all areas of securities law on behalf of the proposed class.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>Id.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">In addition, the court noted, &ldquo;This Court considers [Robbins Geller] &lsquo;a lion&rsquo; at the securities bar on the national level,&rdquo; noting that the Lead Plaintiff selected Robbins Geller because of the Firm&rsquo;s &ldquo;outstanding reputation, experience, and success in securities litigation nationwide.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>Id.</em> at 790.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">The court further stated that &ldquo;Lead Counsel&rsquo;s fearsome reputation and successful track record undoubtedly were substantial factors in . . . obtaining these recoveries.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>Id.</em></p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">Finally, Judge Harmon stated: &ldquo;As this Court has explained [this is] an extraordinary group of attorneys who achieved the largest settlement fund ever despite the great odds against them.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>Id.</em> at 828.</p>               </p>

	<em><strong>Jaffe v. Household Int&rsquo;l, Inc.</strong></em>, No. 02-C-05893 (N.D. Ill). As sole lead counsel, Robbins Geller obtained a record-breaking settlement of <em><strong>$1.575 billion</strong></em> after 14 years of litigation, including a six-week jury trial in 2009 that resulted in a securities fraud verdict in favor of the class. In 2015, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the jury&rsquo;s verdict that defendants made false or misleading statements of material fact about the company&rsquo;s business practices and financial results, but remanded the case for a new trial on the issue of whether the individual defendants &ldquo;made&rdquo; certain false statements, whether those false statements caused plaintiffs&rsquo; losses, and the amount of damages. The parties reached an agreement to settle the case just hours before the retrial was scheduled to begin on June 6, 2016. <em><strong>The $1.575 billion settlement, approved in October 2016, is the largest ever following a securities fraud class action trial, the largest securities fraud settlement in the Seventh Circuit and the seventh-largest settlement ever in a post-PSLRA securities fraud case.</strong></em> According to published reports, the case was just the seventh securities fraud case tried to a verdict since the passage of the PSLRA.


<p style="margin-left:40px">In approving the settlement, the Honorable Jorge L. Alonso noted the team&rsquo;s &ldquo;skill and determination&rdquo; while recognizing that &ldquo;Lead Counsel prosecuted the case vigorously and skillfully over 14 years against nine of the country&rsquo;s most prominent law firms&rdquo; and &ldquo;achieved an exceptionally significant recovery for the class.&rdquo;&nbsp; The court added that the team faced &ldquo;significant hurdles&rdquo; and &ldquo;uphill battles&rdquo; throughout the case and recognized that &ldquo;[c]lass counsel performed a very high-quality legal work in the context of a thorny case in which the state of the law has been and is in flux.&rdquo;&nbsp; The court succinctly concluded that the settlement was &ldquo;a spectacular result for the class.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>Jaffe v.

	<strong><em>In re UnitedHealth Grp. Inc. PSLRA Litig</em>.</strong>, No. 06-CV-1691 (D. Minn.).&nbsp; In the <em>UnitedHealth</em> case, Robbins Geller represented the California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System (&ldquo;CalPERS&rdquo;) and demonstrated its willingness to vigorously advocate for its institutional clients, even under the most difficult circumstances.&nbsp; For example, in 2006, the issue of high-level executives backdating stock options made national headlines.&nbsp; During that time, many law firms, including Robbins Geller, brought shareholder derivative lawsuits against the companies&rsquo; boards of directors for breaches of their fiduciary duties or for improperly granting backdated options.&nbsp; Rather than pursuing a shareholder derivative case, the Firm filed a securities fraud class action against the company on behalf of CalPERS.&nbsp; In doing so, Robbins Geller faced significant and unprecedented legal obstacles with respect to loss causation, <em>i.e.</em>, that defendants&rsquo; actions were responsible for causing the stock losses.&nbsp; Despite these legal hurdles, Robbins Geller obtained an $895 million recovery on behalf of the UnitedHealth shareholders.&nbsp; Shortly after reaching the $895 million settlement with UnitedHealth, the remaining corporate defendants, including former CEO William A. McGuire, also settled.&nbsp; McGuire paid $30 million and returned stock options representing more than three million shares to the shareholders.&nbsp; The total recovery for the class was over $925 million, the largest stock option backdating recovery ever, and <strong><em>a recovery that is more than four times larger than the next largest options backdating recovery</em></strong>.&nbsp; Moreover, Robbins Geller obtained unprecedented corporate governance reforms, including election of a shareholder-nominated member to the company&rsquo;s board of directors, a mandatory holding period for shares acquired by executives via option exercise, and executive compensation reforms that tie pay to performance.

	<strong><em>Luther v. Countrywide Fin. Corp.</em></strong>, No. 12-cv-05125 (C.D. Cal.).&nbsp; Robbins Geller attorneys secured a $500 million settlement for institutional and individual investors in what is the largest RMBS purchaser class action settlement in history, and one of the largest class action securities settlements of all time. &nbsp;The unprecedented settlement resolves claims against Countrywide and Wall Street banks that issued the securities.&nbsp; The action was the first securities class action case filed against originators and Wall Street banks as a result of the credit crisis.&nbsp; As co-lead counsel Robbins Geller forged through six years of hard-fought litigation, oftentimes litigating issues of first impression, in order to secure the landmark settlement for its clients and the class.


<p style="margin-left:40px">In approving the settlement, Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer repeatedly complimented plaintiffs&rsquo; attorneys, noting that it was &ldquo;beyond serious dispute that Class Counsel has vigorously prosecuted the Settlement Actions on both the state and federal level over the last six years.&rdquo; Judge Pfaelzer also commented that &ldquo;[w]ithout a settlement, these cases would continue indefinitely, resulting in significant risks to recovery and continued litigation costs. It is difficult to understate the risks to recovery if litigation had continued.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>Me. State Ret. Sys. v. Countrywide Fin. Corp.</em>, No. 2:10-CV-00302, 2013 U.S. Dist.

<p style="margin-left:40px">As alleged in the complaint, the offering materials for the bonds and preferred securities misstated and failed to disclose the true nature and quality of Wachovia&rsquo;s mortgage loan portfolio, which exposed the bank and misled investors to tens of billions of dollars in losses on mortgage-related assets.&nbsp; In reality, Wachovia employed high-risk underwriting standards and made loans to subprime borrowers, contrary to the offering materials and their statements of &ldquo;pristine credit quality.&rdquo;&nbsp; Robbins Geller served as co-lead counsel representing the City of Livonia Employees&rsquo; Retirement System, Hawaii Sheet Metal Workers Pension Fund, and the investor class.</p>

Ohio).&nbsp; As sole lead counsel representing Cardinal Health shareholders, Robbins Geller obtained a recovery of $600 million for investors.&nbsp; On behalf of the lead plaintiffs, Amalgamated Bank, the New Mexico State Investment Council, and the California Ironworkers Field Trust Fund, the Firm aggressively pursued class claims and won notable courtroom victories, including a favorable decision on defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss.&nbsp; <em>In re Cardinal Health, Inc. Sec. Litigs.</em>, 426 F. Supp. 2d 688 (S.D. Ohio 2006).&nbsp; At the time, the $600 million settlement was the tenth-largest settlement in the history of securities fraud litigation and is the largest-ever recovery in a securities fraud action in the Sixth Circuit.&nbsp; Judge Marbley commented:


<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The quality of representation in this case was superb.&nbsp; Lead Counsel, [Robbins Geller], are nationally recognized leaders in complex securities litigation class actions.&nbsp; The quality of the representation is demonstrated by the substantial benefit achieved for the Class and the efficient, effective prosecution and resolution of this action.&nbsp; Lead Counsel defeated a volley of motions to dismiss, thwarting well-formed challenges from prominent and capable attorneys from six different law firms.</p>

	<strong><em>In re Qwest Commc&rsquo;ns Int&rsquo;l, Inc. Sec. Litig.</em></strong>, No. 01-cv-1451 (D. Colo.).&nbsp; Robbins Geller attorneys served as lead counsel for a class of investors that purchased Qwest securities.&nbsp; In July 2001, the Firm filed the initial complaint in this action on behalf of its clients, long before any investigation into Qwest&rsquo;s financial statements was initiated by the SEC or Department of Justice.&nbsp; After five years of litigation, lead plaintiffs entered into a settlement with Qwest and certain individual defendants that provided a $400 million recovery for the class and created a mechanism that allowed the vast majority of class members to share in an additional $250 million recovered by the SEC.&nbsp; In 2008, Robbins Geller attorneys recovered an additional $45 million for the class in a settlement with defendants Joseph P. Nacchio and Robert S. Woodruff, the CEO and CFO, respectively, of Qwest during large portions of the class period.

Morgan.&nbsp; The settlement represents, on a percentage basis, the largest recovery ever achieved in an MBS purchaser class action.&nbsp; The result was achieved after more than five years of hard-fought litigation and an extensive investigation.&nbsp; In granting approval of the settlement, the court stated the following about Robbins Geller attorneys litigating the case: &ldquo;[T]here is no question in my mind that this is a very good result for the class and that the plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel fought the case very hard with extensive discovery, a lot of depositions, several rounds of briefing of various legal issues going all the way through class certification.&rdquo;

	<strong><em>NECA-IBEW Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</em></strong>, No. 1:08-cv-10783 (S.D.N.Y.).&nbsp; As sole lead counsel, Robbins Geller obtained a $272 million settlement on behalf of Goldman Sachs&rsquo; shareholders.&nbsp; The settlement concludes one of the last remaining mortgage-backed securities purchaser class actions arising out of the global financial crisis.&nbsp; The remarkable result was achieved following seven years of extensive litigation.&nbsp; After the claims were dismissed in 2010, Robbins Geller secured a landmark victory from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that clarified the scope of permissible class actions asserting claims under the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of MBS investors.&nbsp; Specifically, the Second Circuit&rsquo;s decision rejected the concept of &ldquo;tranche&rdquo; standing and concluded that a lead plaintiff in an MBS class action has class standing to pursue claims on behalf of purchasers of other securities that were issued from the same registration statement and backed by pools of mortgages originated by the same lenders who had originated mortgages backing the lead plaintiff&rsquo;s securities.


<p style="margin-left:40px">In approving the settlement, the Honorable Loretta A. Preska of the Southern District of New York complimented Robbins Geller attorneys, noting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel, thank you for your papers.&nbsp; They were, by the way, extraordinary papers in support of the settlement, and I will particularly note Professor Miller&rsquo;s declaration in which he details the procedural aspects of the case and then speaks of plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel&rsquo;s success in the Second Circuit essentially changing the law.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also note what counsel have said, and that is that this case illustrates the proper functioning of the statute.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel, you can all be proud of what you&rsquo;ve done for your clients.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve done an extraordinarily good job.</p>

	<em><strong>Schuh v. HCA Holdings, Inc.</strong></em>, No. 3:11-cv-01033 (M.D. Tenn.). As sole lead counsel, Robbins Geller obtained a groundbreaking $215 million settlement for former HCA Holdings, Inc. shareholders &ndash; the largest securities class action recovery ever in Tennessee. Reached shortly before trial was scheduled to commence, the settlement resolves claims that the Registration Statement and Prospectus HCA filed in connection with the company&rsquo;s massive $4.3 billion 2011 IPO contained material misstatements and omissions. The recovery achieved approximately 70% of classwide damages, which as a percentage of damages significantly exceeds the median class action recovery of 2%-3% of damages. At the hearing on final approval of the settlement, the Honorable Kevin H. Sharp described Robbins Geller attorneys as &ldquo;gladiators&rdquo; and commented: &ldquo;Looking at the benefit obtained, the effort that you had to put into it, [and] the complexity in this case . . . I appreciate the work that you all have done on this.&rdquo; <em>Schuh v. HCA Holdings, Inc.</em>, No. 3:11-CV-01033, Transcript at 12-13 (M.D. Tenn. Apr. 11, 2016).

	<strong><em>Silverman v. Motorola, Inc.</em></strong>, No. 1:07-cv-04507 (N.D. Ill.).&nbsp; The Firm served as lead counsel on behalf of a class of investors in Motorola, Inc., ultimately recovering $200 million for investors just two months before the case was set for trial.&nbsp; This outstanding result was obtained despite the lack of an SEC investigation or any financial restatement.&nbsp; In May 2012, the Honorable Amy J. St. Eve of the Northern District of Illinois commented: &ldquo;The representation that [Robbins Geller] provided to the class was significant, both in terms of quality and quantity.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>Silverman v.

<p style="margin-left:40px">In affirming the district court&rsquo;s award of attorneys&rsquo; fees, the Seventh Circuit noted that &ldquo;no other law firm was willing to serve as lead counsel.&nbsp; Lack of competition not only implies a higher fee but also suggests that most members of the securities bar saw this litigation as too risky for their practices.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>Silverman v.

Michael Armstrong, with violations of the federal securities laws in connection with AT&amp;T&rsquo;s April 2000 initial public offering of its wireless tracking stock, the largest IPO in American history.&nbsp; After two weeks of trial, and on the eve of scheduled testimony by Armstrong and infamous telecom analyst Jack Grubman, defendants agreed to settle the case for $100 million.&nbsp; In granting approval of the settlement, the court stated the following about the Robbins Geller attorneys handling the case:


<blockquote>
<p>Lead Counsel are highly skilled attorneys with great experience in prosecuting complex securities action[s], and their professionalism and diligence displayed during [this] litigation substantiates this characterization.&nbsp; The Court notes that Lead Counsel displayed excellent lawyering skills through their consistent preparedness during court proceedings, arguments and the trial, and their well-written and thoroughly researched submissions to the Court.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, the attentive and persistent effort of Lead Counsel was integral in achieving the excellent result for the Class.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . Based upon Lead Plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel&rsquo;s diligent efforts on behalf of the Class, as well as their skill and reputations, Lead Plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel were able to negotiate a very favorable result for the Class. . . .&nbsp; The ability of [Robbins Geller] to obtain such a favorable partial settlement for the Class in the face of such formidable opposition confirms the superior quality of their representation . . . .</p>

	<strong><em>Does I v. The Gap, Inc.</em></strong>, No. 01 0031 (D. N. Mar. I.).&nbsp; In this groundbreaking case, Robbins Geller attorneys represented a class of 30,000 garment workers who alleged that they had worked under sweatshop conditions in garment factories in Saipan that produced clothing for top U.S. retailers such as The Gap, Target and J.C. Penney.&nbsp; In the first action of its kind, Robbins Geller attorneys pursued claims against the factories and the retailers alleging violations of RICO, the Alien Tort Claims Act, and the Law of Nations based on the alleged systemic labor and human rights abuses occurring in Saipan.&nbsp; This case was a companion to two other actions: <strong><em>Does I v. Advance Textile Corp.</em></strong>, No. 99 0002 (D. N. Mar. I.), which alleged overtime violations by the garment factories under the Fair Labor Standards Act and local labor law, and <strong><em>UNITE v. The Gap, Inc.</em></strong>, No. 300474 (Cal. Super. Ct., San Francisco Cty.), which alleged violations of California&rsquo;s Unfair Practices Law by the U.S. retailers.&nbsp; These actions resulted in a settlement of approximately $20 million that included a comprehensive monitoring program to address past violations by the factories and prevent future ones.&nbsp; The members of the litigation team were honored as Trial Lawyers of the Year by the Trial Lawyers for Public Justice in recognition of the team&rsquo;s efforts in bringing about the precedent-setting settlement of the actions.

	<strong><em>NECA-IBEW Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</em></strong>, 693 F.3d 145 (2d Cir. 2012).&nbsp; In a securities fraud action involving mortgage-backed securities, the Second Circuit rejected the concept of &ldquo;tranche&rdquo; standing and found that a lead plaintiff has class standing to pursue claims on behalf of purchasers of securities that were backed by pools of mortgages originated by the same lenders who had originated mortgages backing the lead plaintiff&rsquo;s securities.&nbsp; The court noted that, given those common lenders, the lead plaintiff&rsquo;s claims as to its purchases implicated &ldquo;the same set of concerns&rdquo; that purchasers in several of the other offerings possessed.&nbsp; The court also rejected the notion that the lead plaintiff lacked standing to represent investors in different tranches.

	<strong><em>In re VeriFone Holdings, Inc. Sec. Litig.</em></strong>, 704 F.3d 694 (9th Cir. 2012).&nbsp; The panel reversed in part and affirmed in part the dismissal of investors&rsquo; securities fraud class action alleging violations of &sect;&sect;10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 in connection with a restatement of financial results of the company in which the investors had purchased stock.


<p style="margin-left:40px">The panel held that the third amended complaint adequately pleaded the &sect;10(b), &sect;20A and Rule 10b-5 claims.&nbsp; Considering the allegations of scienter holistically, as the U.S. Supreme Court directed in <em>Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano</em>, 563 U.S 27, 48-49 (2011), the panel concluded that the inference that the defendant company and its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer were deliberately reckless as to the truth of their financial reports and related public statements following a merger was at least as compelling as any opposing inference.</p>               </p>

Brooks Smith praised Robbins Geller partner Joe Daley&rsquo;s efforts in this litigation:


<blockquote>
<p>Thank you very much Mr. Daley and a thank you to all counsel.&nbsp; As Judge Cowen mentioned, this was an exquisitely well-briefed case; it was also an extremely well-argued case, and we thank counsel for their respective jobs here in the matter, which we will take under advisement.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

	<strong><em>Alaska Elec. Pension Fund v. Brown</em></strong>, 941 A.2d 1011 (Del. 2007).&nbsp; The Supreme Court of Delaware held that the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund, for purposes of the &ldquo;corporate benefit&rdquo; attorney-fee doctrine, was presumed to have caused a substantial increase in the tender offer price paid in a &ldquo;going private&rdquo; buyout transaction.&nbsp; The Court of Chancery originally ruled that Alaska&rsquo;s counsel, Robbins Geller, was not entitled to an award of attorney fees, but Delaware&rsquo;s high court, in its published opinion, reversed and remanded for further proceedings.

Curiel hailed the settlement as &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; and &ldquo;all the more exceptional when viewed in light of the risk&rdquo; of continued litigation. &nbsp;The court further commended Robbins Geller for prosecuting the case on a <em>pro bono</em> basis: &ldquo;Class Counsel&rsquo;s exceptional decision to provide nearly seven years of legal services to Class Members on a <em>pro bono</em> basis evidences not only a lack of collusion, but also that Class Counsel are in fact representing the best interests of Plaintiffs and the Class Members in this Settlement. &nbsp;Instead of seeking compensation for fees and costs that they would otherwise be entitled to, Class Counsel have acted to allow maximum recovery to Plaintiffs and Class Members. &nbsp;Indeed, that Eligible Class Members may receive recovery of 90% or greater is a testament to Class Counsel&rsquo;s representation and dedication to act in their clients&rsquo; best interest.&rdquo; &nbsp;In addition, at the final approval hearing, the court commented that &quot;this is a case that has been litigated &ndash;&nbsp;if not fiercely, zealously throughout.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Low v.

                 <p>Jason Alperstein is a partner in the Firm&rsquo;s Boca Raton office.&nbsp; His practices focuses on consumer fraud, securities fraud, mass torts and data breach litigation.&nbsp; Alperstein was an integral member of the&nbsp;<em>In re Volkswagen &ldquo;Clean Diesel&rdquo; Marketing, Sales Practices, &amp; Prods. Liab. Litig.</em>, No. 15-md-2672 (N.D. Cal.), litigation team, prosecuting claims on behalf of almost 600,000 consumers who were duped into purchasing and leasing Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche vehicles that were marketed as environmentally friendly, yet spewed toxic pollutants up to 40 times the legal limit permitted by the EPA. Working closely with Plaintiffs&rsquo; Steering Committee (&ldquo;PSC&rdquo;) member Paul J. Geller, Alperstein was involved in almost all aspects of the litigation. The PSC and government agencies ultimately reached a series of settlements on behalf of purchasers, lessees and dealers that totaled well over $17 billion, the largest consumer automotive settlement in history.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alperstein is actively involved in a number of other class actions and MDLs pending throughout the country, including:&nbsp;<em>In re Yahoo! Inc. Customer Data Security Breach Litig.</em>, No. 16-md-02752 (N.D. Cal.), regarding the largest data breach in history;&nbsp;<em>In re FieldTurf Artificial Turf Mktg. &amp; Sales Practices Litig.</em>, No. 17-md-02779 (D.N.J.), concerning the sale of defective synthetic turf for use in athletic fields;&nbsp;<em>In re Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep Ecodiesel Mktg., Sales Practices &amp; Prods.

Mich.), relating to the dumping of toxic waste and polluting of groundwater in Kent County, Michigan.</p>

<p>Prior to joining Robbins Geller, Alperstein served on lead and co-lead litigation teams in nationwide and statewide class action lawsuits against dozens of the largest banking institutions in connection with the unlawful assessment of checking account overdraft fees.&nbsp; His efforts resulted in over $250 million in settlements for his clients and significant changes in the way banks charge overdraft fees to their customers.&nbsp; In addition, he led consumer class actions against product manufacturers for false and deceptive labeling, and some of the world&rsquo;s largest clothing retailers for their use of false and deceptive comparative pricing in their outlet stores.&nbsp;</p>               </p>

                 <p>Jason Forge is a partner in the Firm&rsquo;s San Diego office, specializing in complex investigations, litigation and trials.&nbsp; As a federal prosecutor and private practitioner, he has conducted and supervised scores of jury and bench trials in federal and state courts, including the month-long trial of a defense contractor who conspired with Congressman Randy &ldquo;Duke&rdquo; Cunningham in the largest bribery scheme in congressional history.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forge was a key member of the litigation team that secured a historic recovery on behalf of Trump University students in two class actions against President Donald J. Trump.&nbsp; The settlement refunds over 90% of the money thousands of students paid to &ldquo;enroll&rdquo; in Trump University. &nbsp;He represented the class on a <em>pro bono</em> basis. &nbsp;Forge has also successfully defeated motions to dismiss and obtained class certification against several prominent defendants, including the first securities fraud case against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and the first federal RICO&nbsp;case against Scotts Miracle-Gro. &nbsp;In a case against another prominent defendant, Pfizer Inc., he led an investigation that uncovered key documents that Pfizer had not produced in discovery.&nbsp; Although fact discovery in the case had already closed, the district judge ruled that the documents had been improperly withheld, and ordered that discovery be reopened, including reopening the depositions of Pfizer&rsquo;s former CEO, CFO and General Counsel.&nbsp; Less than six months after completing these depositions, Pfizer settled the case for $400 million.&nbsp; Forge has also taught trial practice techniques on local and national levels, and has written and argued many state and federal appeals, including an <em>en banc</em> argument in the Ninth Circuit. &nbsp;He also teaches White Collar Crime at the University of San Diego School of Law.</p>               </p>

                 <p>Paul Geller, Managing Partner of Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP&rsquo;s Boca Raton, Florida of&#64257;ce, is a Founding Partner of the Firm, a member of its Executive and Management Committees and head of the Firm&rsquo;s Consumer Practice Group.&nbsp; Geller&rsquo;s 25 years of litigation experience is broad, and he has handled cases in each of the Firm&rsquo;s practice areas.&nbsp; Notably, before devoting his practice to the representation of consumers and investors, he defended companies in high-stakes class action litigation, providing him an invaluable perspective.&nbsp; Geller has tried bench and jury trials on both the plaintiffs&rsquo; and defendants&rsquo; sides, and has argued before numerous state, federal and appellate courts throughout the country.</p>

<p>Geller was recently selected to serve in a leadership position on behalf of governmental entities and other plaintiffs in the sprawling litigation concerning the nationwide prescription opioid epidemic.&nbsp; In reporting on the selection of the lawyers to lead the case, <em>The National Law Journal</em> reported that &ldquo;[t]he team reads like a &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s Who&rsquo; in mass torts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Geller was also part of the leadership team representing consumers in the massive <em>Volkswagen &ldquo;Clean Diesel&rdquo; Emissions</em> case.&nbsp; The San Francisco legal newspaper <em>The Recorder</em> labeled the group that was appointed in that case, which settled for more than $17&nbsp;billion, a &ldquo;class action dream team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Geller is also currently serving&nbsp; as Co-Lead Counsel in <em>In re EpiPen (Epinephrine Injection, USP) Mktg., Sales Practices &amp; Antitrust Litig.</em>, a nationwide class action that alleges that pharmaceutical company Mylan N.V. and others engaged in anticompetitive and unfair business conduct in its sale and marketing of the EpiPen Auto-Injector device.</p>

<p>Some of Geller&rsquo;s other recent noteworthy successes include a $265 million recovery against Massey Energy in <em>In re Massey Energy Co. Sec. Litig.</em>, in which Massey was found accountable for a tragic explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in Raleigh County, West Virginia.&nbsp; Geller also secured a $146.25 million recovery against Duke Energy in <em>Nieman v. Duke Energy Corp</em>., the largest recovery in North Carolina for a case involving securities fraud, and one of the &#64257;ve largest recoveries in the Fourth Circuit.</p>               </p>

                 <p>Darren Robbins is a founding partner of Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP. &nbsp;Over the last two decades, he has served as lead counsel in more than 100 securities class actions and has recovered billions of dollars for injured shareholders. &nbsp;Robbins has obtained significant recoveries in a number of actions arising out of wrongdoing related to the issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities, including the case against Goldman Sachs ($272 million recovery). &nbsp;Robbins also served as co-lead counsel in connection with a $627 million recovery for investors in&nbsp;<em>In re Wachovia Preferred Securities &amp; Bond/Notes Litig.</em>, one of the largest credit-crisis settlements involving Securities Act claims. &nbsp;Robbins also recently served as lead counsel in&nbsp;<em>Schuh v.&nbsp;HCA&nbsp;Holdings, Inc</em>., which resulted in a $215 million recovery for shareholders.</p>

<p>One of the hallmarks of Robbins&rsquo; practice has been his focus on corporate governance reform. &nbsp;In&nbsp;<em>UnitedHealth</em>, a securities fraud class action arising out of an options backdating scandal, Robbins represented lead plaintiff CalPERS and was able to obtain the cancellation of more than 3.6 million stock options held by the company&rsquo;s former CEO and secure a record $925 million cash recovery for shareholders. &nbsp;Robbins also negotiated sweeping corporate governance reforms, including the election of a shareholder-nominated director to the company&rsquo;s board of directors, a mandatory holding period for shares acquired via option exercise, and compensation reforms that tied executive pay to performance. &nbsp;Recently, Robbins led a shareholder derivative action brought by several pension funds on behalf of Community Health Systems, Inc. &nbsp;The case yielded a $60 million payment to Community Health, as well as corporate governance reforms that included two shareholder-nominated directors, the creation and appointment of a Healthcare Law Compliance Coordinator, the implementation of an executive compensation clawback in the event of a restatement, the establishment of an insider trading controls committee, and the adoption of a political expenditure disclosure policy.</p>               </p>
